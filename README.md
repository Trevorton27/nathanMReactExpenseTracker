## Summary
This application is an expense tracker that allows the user to input data points of an expendure to include: date, place, item, amount, and payment type.  This data is displayed in a HTML table and the user may delete entries from the table.  This project was made using React App, Bootstrap CSS, and Nodejs.  The react app was initialized using create-react-app and functional components with hooks were implemented in the app.  Building this application taught the premise and basis for passing props and states from one component to another.
